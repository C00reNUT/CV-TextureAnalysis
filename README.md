# Computer Vision - Texture Synthesis
This is the first part of the project where the goal is to implement and evaluate the idea of Texture Synthesis by Non-Parametric Sampling as proposed by Efros and Leung, ICCV99.  
<br/>
The paper can be found at this link : http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/NPS/efros-iccv99.pdf

## Getting Started
We are given a pseudo code of the implementation of Non-Parametric Sampling algorithm which we need to run on the sample gif images to synthesize a 200x200 pixel image.  
<br/>
We repeat this for various WindowSize parameters and evaluate the performance and quality of the synthesized image.
